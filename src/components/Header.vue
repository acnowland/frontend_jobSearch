            <p class="body introduction wrap">Right now, there are hundred of resources available for you to find a job. Why is it then, so hard for you to 
                ACTUALLY find a job? As a junior developer, we are learning new technologies every week, we are refactoring our resumes
                to make them stand apart, we are updating our LinkedIn, we are writing blogs..... and the list goes on and on. On top of all of that, 
                you have to actually be searching for a job as well. For me, searching and applying for jobs, has well.. been a full time job in itself. 
                That is why I am making this website. It will be ran by US, the job seekers, and will provide a place to post the jobs that we come across
                on our hunt. Now, instead of having to navigate 5 different websites to find a job posting, you can come here. This comes with a caveate though... 
                We must be in this togethor. We each have to do our duty posting jobs we find that each other may benefit from. And with that.... goodluck on the hunt.
